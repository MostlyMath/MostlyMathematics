    "text": "Introduction\nIn functional analysis and related areas, we often encounter functions that speak of the relationships between points in a space (a metric or a distance function for instance). A kernel is such a function, taking two inputs and returning a real or a complex number, which can be interpreted as a measure of similarity or interaction.\nAmongst these kernels, a special class called positive definite kernels play a central role as they are characterized by an intrinsic property that guarantees the existence of an associated Hilbert space of functions (a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which we shall look into in another post).\nPositive definite kernels are not just abstract objects, they also provide the foundation for constructing function spaces, understanding linear operators, and formulating problems in approximation theory and analysis. In this post, we will define positive definite kernels, explore some properties, and look into some examples.\n\n\nPositive Definite Kernels\nLet us look at positive definite kernels in the real-valued case first.\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) be a set. \\(k: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is a positive definite kernel if \\(k(x,y) = k(y,x)\\) and for every \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(c_1, \\dots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) we have that \\[\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} c_i c_j k(x_i, x_j) \\ge 0,\\] i.e. the symmetric matrix:\n\n\n\\((k(x_i, x_j))_{i,j=1}^{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nk(x_1, x_1) & \\cdots & k(x_1, x_n) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nk(x_n, x_1) & \\cdots & k(x_n, x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix}\\) is positive semidefinite.\n\nNote that the symmetric matrix \\((k(x_i, x_j))_{i,j=1}^{n}\\) is often called a Gram matrix.\nIn the complex-valued case, the Hermitian property \\(k(y,x) = \\overline{k(x,y)}\\) is derived from the positive-definiteness itself.\n\nLet \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) be a set. \\(k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) is a positive definite kernel if for every \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(c_1, \\dots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{C}\\), we have that \\[\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} c_i \\overline{c_j} k(x_i, x_j) \\ge 0.\\]\n\nBefore looking into some examples of positive definite kernels, we will look into some properties of the same and try to construct new positive definite kernels from the existing ones.\n\nProposition 1: Assume \\(k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) is positive definite. Then, for any \\(x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}\\),\n1. \\(k(x,x) \\geq 0\\).\n2. \\(\\lvert k(x,y) \\rvert^2 \\leq k(x,x) k(y,y)\\).\n\nThe first statement is obvious from the definition (take \\(n=1, c_1 = 1, x_1 = x\\)). For (2) since a hermitian matrix is positive semidefinite iff all its eigenvalues are non-negative (Check!) and hence the determinant must be non-negative which gives us this inequality.\n\nProposition 2: If \\(k_i : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\ (i=1,2,\\ldots)\\) are positive definite kernels, then the following are also positive definite kernels.\n1. \\(ak_1 + bk_2 \\quad (a,b \\geq 0)\\) (positive combination)\n2. \\(k_1 k_2\\) (product)\n3. \\(\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} k_i(x,y),\\) assuming the limit exists.\n\n\nProposition 3: Let \\(V\\) be a vector space with an inner product \\(\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle\\). If we have a map \\(\\Phi : \\mathcal{X} \\to V; x \\mapsto \\Phi(x)\\), a positive definite kernel on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is defined by \\[k(x,y) = \\langle \\Phi(x), \\Phi(y) \\rangle.\\]\n\n\nProposition 4: Let \\(k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) be a positive definite kernel and \\(f : \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) be an arbitrary function. Then, \\(\\tilde{k}(x,y) = f(x) \\, k(x,y) \\, \\overline{f(y)}\\) is positive definite. In particular, \\(f(x)\\overline{f(y)}\\) is a positive definite kernel.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nLinear Kernel: \\[k_0(x,y) = x^{T}y\\]\nExponential Kernel: \\[k_E(x,y) = exp(\\beta x^{T}y) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\beta &gt; 0\\]\n\nGaussian Radial Basis Function Kernel: \\[\nk_G(x,y) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\|x-y\\|^2\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad (\\sigma &gt; 0)\\]",

    "text": "When we talk of dynamical systems, the basic idea is that we pick a space \\(X\\), choose a rule \\(T: X \\to X\\), and then we keep applying that rule over and over again to a point \\(x \\in X\\).\nSo if we start with \\(x\\), then apply \\(T\\), we obtain \\(T(x)\\). Applying it again, we obtain \\(T^2(x)\\), then \\(T^3(x)\\), and so on. The sequence\n\\[\nx, \\; T(x), \\; T^2(x), \\; T^3(x), \\dots\n\\]\nis called the orbit of \\(x\\) under \\(T\\) which is the most natural object to study since the orbit tells us the future path of the point.\nNow a good question to ask would be: What happens to these orbits in the longer run? One can wonder if they keep running away to new territories forever? Or if they loop back and revisit old places? Or if they somehow spread out evenly across space?\nConsider the following simple example:\n\nIf \\(X\\) is a circle and \\(T\\) is rotation by \\(90^\\circ\\), then orbits are perfectly periodic. After four steps, we are back at where we started.\n\nIf the angle is irrational, then the orbit never lands exactly where it started. But it does keep wandering around the circle in such a way that eventually it perhaps comes arbitrarily close to the starting point.\n\nSo a nice thing to wonder would be if coming back close to where we started is a general phenomenon or not.\nTo even begin answering this, we need some extra structure. Just having a set \\(X\\) and a map \\(T\\) is too vague. What we want is a way to say something like: “most points behave this way.” And the right tool for that is measure theory.\nIf we give our space a measure (so we can talk about sizes of sets, probabilities, and so on), and if our transformation \\(T\\) respects that measure, we might be able to answer our question. And hence we consider the setting of a measure-preserving system.\nAnd in this setting we have a deep and beautiful result: the Poincaré Recurrence Theorem, which tells us something quite striking about orbits. But before we get there, let’s first understand what measure-preserving systems actually are.",
