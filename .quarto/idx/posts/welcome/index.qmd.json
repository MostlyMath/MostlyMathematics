Note that the symmetric matrix $(k(x_i, x_j))_{i,j=1}^{n}$ is often called a **Gram matrix**.\n\nIn the complex-valued case, the Hermitian property $k(y,x) = \\overline{k(x,y)}$ is derived from the positive-definiteness itself.\n\n> Let $\\mathcal{X}$ be a set. \n$k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a **positive definite kernel**\nif for every $x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $c_1, \\dots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we have that $$\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} c_i \\overline{c_j} k(x_i, x_j) \\ge 0.$$\n\nBefore looking into some examples of positive definite kernels, we will look into some properties of the same and try to construct new positive definite kernels from the existing ones.\n\n> **Proposition 1:** Assume $k : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is positive definite. Then, for any $x, y \\in \\mathcal{X}$,  \n  > 1. $k(x,x) \\geq 0$.  \n  > 2. $\\lvert k(x,y) \\rvert^2 \\leq k(x,x) k(y,y)$.\n\n> Proof: (1) is obvious from the definition (take $n=1, c_1 = 1, x_1 = x$). For (2) since a hermitian matrix is positive semidefinite iff all its eigenvalues are non-negative (Check!), the determinant must be non-negative which gives us this inequality.\n\nFrom Proposition 1 we get the hints of structure hidden in positive definite kernels. The non-negativity of $k(x,x)$ and the Cauchy-Schwarz-type inequality suggest that these kernels behave a lot like inner products even if we haven’t formally embedded the points in a Hilbert space yet.\n\nOne nice property of positive definite kernels is that adding kernels, multiplying them, or taking limits produces new positive definite kernels. This lets us construct more complex kernels from simple ones.\n\n\n> **Proposition 2:** If $k_i : \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\ (i=1,2,\\ldots)$ are positive definite kernels, then the following are also positive definite kernels.   \n  > 1. $ak_1 + bk_2 \\quad (a,b \\geq 0)$ (positive combination)  \n  > 2. $k_1 k_2$ (product)  \n  > 3. $\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} k_i(x,y),$ assuming the limit exists.  \n\n> Proof: (1) and (3) are easy to see and for (2), it is enough to show that if two Hermitian matrices $A$ and $B$ are positive semidefinite, so is their component wise product (the Hadamard product). This can be done by taking the eigendecomposition of $A$ and then checking for the positve semidefiniteness of the Hadamard product.\n\nSo far we looked at kernels abstractly. Proposition 3 shows how positive definite kernels naturally arise from inner products in some vector space.
